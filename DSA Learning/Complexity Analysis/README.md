# Complexity Analysis

Welcome to the **Complexity Analysis** section of your DSA Interview Preparation repository! This README provides a detailed, beginner-friendly guide to understanding complexity analysis, a critical skill for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms in coding interviews. You’ll learn about Big O notation, time and space complexity, and how to analyze algorithms with practical examples and common interview questions.

## Introduction
Complexity analysis helps you measure how an algorithm’s performance (time and space usage) scales with input size. For AI/ML freshers preparing for CSE interviews, mastering this skill is essential to optimize solutions and demonstrate technical expertise. This guide breaks down complex concepts into simple explanations, with Python examples to make learning accessible and actionable.

## 1. What is Complexity Analysis?

Complexity analysis evaluates an algorithm’s efficiency in terms of:
- **Time Complexity**: How the running time grows as the input size increases.
- **Space Complexity**: How the memory usage grows as the input size increases.

By understanding complexity, you can compare algorithms, optimize code, and answer interview questions about performance trade-offs.

## 2. Big O Notation

### Definition
Big O notation describes the **upper bound** of an algorithm’s running time or space requirements as a function of the input size (n). It focuses on the worst-case scenario and ignores constants and lower-order terms to provide a simplified measure of efficiency.

### Common Big O Notations
| Notation     | Description                                   | Example Use Case                       |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| O(1)         | Constant time – Independent of input size     | Accessing an array element             |
| O(log n)     | Logarithmic time – Halves problem size       | Binary search                          |
| O(n)         | Linear time – Scales directly with input     | Linear search                          |
| O(n log n)   | Linearithmic time – Efficient for sorting    | Merge sort, Quick sort                 |
| O(n²)        | Quadratic time – Nested loops                | Bubble sort, Selection sort            |
| O(2ⁿ)        | Exponential time – Doubles with each step    | Recursive Fibonacci without memoization|
| O(n!)        | Factorial time – Permutations                | Traveling Salesman Problem             |

### Visualizing Big O
- **O(1)**: Flat line – No growth.
- **O(log n)**: Slow growth – Ideal for large datasets.
- **O(n)**: Linear growth – Common in simple algorithms.
- **O(n²)**: Steep curve – Inefficient for large inputs.
- **O(2ⁿ)**: Explosive growth – Avoid in practice.

## 3. Time Complexity

### Definition
Time complexity measures the number of operations an algorithm performs as a function of the input size (n). It helps predict how long an algorithm will take to run for large inputs.

### How to Calculate Time Complexity
1. **Identify Operations**: Count basic operations (assignments, comparisons, arithmetic).
2. **Analyze Loops**:
   - Single loop: O(n) if it iterates n times.
   - Nested loops: O(n²) for two loops, O(n³) for three, etc.
   - Divide-and-conquer: O(log n) or O(n log n) for halving problems.
3. **Drop Constants and Lower-Order Terms**: Focus on the dominant term (e.g., O(n² + n) becomes O(n²)).
4. **Consider Worst Case**: Big O assumes the worst-case scenario unless specified.

### Example 1: Linear Search
```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

# Example usage
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(linear_search(arr, 5))  # Output: 2
```

**Analysis**:
- Loop runs n times in the worst case (target not found or at the end).
- Each iteration performs O(1) operations (comparison, return).
- **Time Complexity**: O(n).

### Example 2: Binary Search
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(binary_search(arr, 3))  # Output: 2
```

**Analysis**:
- Search space halves each iteration (log n steps).
- Each iteration performs O(1) operations (comparison, assignment).
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n).

### Example 3: Nested Loops
```python
def print_pairs(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(len(arr)):
            print(arr[i], arr[j])

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3]
print_pairs(arr)  # Prints all pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), ...
```

**Analysis**:
- Outer loop: n iterations.
- Inner loop: n iterations for each outer iteration.
- Total operations: n * n = n².
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²).

## 4. Space Complexity

### Definition
Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size (n). It includes:
- **Auxiliary Space**: Extra memory used by the algorithm (e.g., temporary arrays, recursion stack).
- **Input Space**: Memory for the input data (often excluded in analysis).

### How to Calculate Space Complexity
1. **Count Variables**: Include temporary variables, arrays, or data structures.
2. **Analyze Recursion**: Each recursive call adds to the call stack.
3. **Consider Data Structures**: Account for space used by stacks, queues, or trees.
4. **Drop Constants**: Focus on the dominant term (e.g., O(n + 5) becomes O(n)).

### Example 1: Iterative Sum
```python
def sum_array(arr):
    total = 0
    for num in arr:
        total += num
    return total

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum_array(arr))  # Output: 15
```

**Analysis**:
- Variables: `total` (O(1)), `num` (O(1)).
- No extra data structures or recursion.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (constant space).

### Example 2: Recursive Fibonacci
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
```

**Analysis**:
- Recursion creates n call stack frames (one for each recursive call).
- Each frame stores O(1) data (n, return value).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) (due to call stack).

### Example 3: Merge Sort
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]
        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half)
        i = j = k = 0
        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1

# Example usage
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12]
merge_sort(arr)
print(arr)  # Output: [12, 25, 34, 64]
```

**Analysis**:
- Temporary arrays: `left_half` and `right_half` (total O(n) space).
- Recursion: O(log n) call stack frames (due to halving).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) (dominant term from temporary arrays).

## 5. Practical Tips for Complexity Analysis

### In Interviews
- **Explain Your Analysis**: Walk through loops, recursion, or data structures to justify your complexity.
- **Consider Trade-offs**: Discuss time vs. space trade-offs (e.g., memoization reduces time but increases space).
- **Optimize for Constraints**: If n is small, O(n²) may be acceptable; for large n, aim for O(n log n) or better.
- **Ask Clarifications**: Confirm if input is sorted, unique, or has other properties that affect complexity.

### Common Patterns
- **Single Loop**: Often O(n).
- **Nested Loops**: Typically O(n²), O(n³), etc., depending on depth.
- **Divide-and-Conquer**: Often O(log n) or O(n log n).
- **Recursive Calls**: Check if memoization or tabulation reduces complexity.
- **Auxiliary Data Structures**: Hash tables (O(n)), stacks/queues (O(n)), etc.

### Tools for Practice
- Visualize algorithm performance with tools like [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/).
- Practice problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and analyze their complexities.
- Use a whiteboard or paper to break down loops and recursion step-by-step.

## 6. Common Interview Questions

Complexity analysis is a frequent topic in interviews. Here are common questions and how to approach them:

1. **What is the time complexity of this algorithm?**
   - Example: For a nested loop iterating n times each, explain it’s O(n²).
   - Tip: Break down the code into loops, recursion, or data structure operations.

2. **How can you optimize this solution?**
   - Example: Replace O(n²) bubble sort with O(n log n) merge sort.
   - Tip: Suggest data structures (e.g., hash table for O(1) lookup) or algorithms (e.g., binary search).

3. **What’s the space complexity of recursive vs. iterative solutions?**
   - Example: Recursive Fibonacci is O(n) due to the call stack, while iterative is O(1).
   - Tip: Highlight auxiliary space and recursion stack usage.

4. **Why is O(n log n) the lower bound for comparison-based sorting?**
   - Explain: Comparison-based sorting requires at least log(n!) comparisons, which simplifies to O(n log n).
   - Tip: Reference decision tree model for sorting.

5. **Analyze the complexity of a specific problem.**
   - Example: For “Two Sum” using a hash table, time is O(n), space is O(n).
   - Tip: Walk through the algorithm step-by-step, counting operations and memory.

### Practice Problems
- **Two Sum**: Analyze time/space complexity with brute force vs. hash table ([LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)).
- **Maximum Subarray**: Analyze Kadane’s algorithm (O(n) time, O(1) space).
- **Merge Intervals**: Analyze sorting-based solution (O(n log n) time, O(n) space).
- **Longest Common Subsequence**: Analyze DP solution (O(m*n) time, O(m*n) space).
