## Basic Data Structures

### Arrays
1. **What is an array? What are its advantages and disadvantages?**  
   - An array is a linear data structure storing elements of the same type in contiguous memory. **Advantages**: Fast access (O(1)), memory-efficient. **Disadvantages**: Fixed size, O(n) for insertion/deletion.

2. **How do you access an element in an array? What is the time complexity?**  
   - Use the index, e.g., `arr[index]`. **Time Complexity**: O(1) due to direct memory access.

3. **What is a multidimensional array?**  
   - An array with multiple dimensions, e.g., a 2D array (matrix) for grids or tables.

4. **What are the differences between row-major and column-major order in 2D arrays?**  
   - Row-major stores rows contiguously; column-major stores columns contiguously. Affects memory access patterns.

### Strings
5. **What is a string? How is it different from an array?**  
   - A string is a sequence of characters, often an array of characters. Strings may be immutable in some languages, unlike mutable arrays.

6. **What are common string operations?**  
   - Concatenation, substring extraction, pattern matching, palindrome checking.

7. **What is the significance of immutability in strings?**  
   - Immutability ensures strings cannot be modified, improving thread safety but requiring new memory for changes.

### Linked Lists
8. **What is a linked list? What are its types?**  
   - A linked list is a linear structure where nodes contain data and a reference to the next node. **Types**: Singly, doubly, circular linked lists.

9. **What are the advantages of a linked list over an array?**  
   - Dynamic size, efficient insertion/deletion (O(1) at head), no contiguous memory needed.

10. **What is the difference between a singly and doubly linked list?**  
    - Singly linked lists point to the next node; doubly linked lists point to both next and previous nodes, enabling bidirectional traversal.

11. **What are applications of linked lists?**  
    - Implementing stacks, queues, graphs, and maintaining ordered lists.

### Stacks
12. **What is a stack? What are its main operations?**  
    - A stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure. **Operations**: Push, pop, peek, isEmpty.

13. **What are real-world applications of stacks?**  
    - Function call management, undo/redo, expression evaluation, backtracking.

14. **How can a stack be implemented?**  
    - Using arrays (fixed size) or linked lists (dynamic size).

### Queues
15. **What is a queue? What are its main operations?**

16. **How is a queue different from a stack?**

20. **What is a binary tree? What are its properties?**  
    - A binary tree has nodes with at most two children (left, right). **Properties**: Root node, leaf nodes, height.

21. **What is a binary search tree (BST)? How does it differ from a binary tree?**  
    - A BST ensures left subtree nodes are smaller, right subtree nodes are larger than the parent. Unlike binary trees, it maintains order.

22. **What are BST operations and their time complexities?**  
    - Insertion, deletion, search: O(log n) average, O(n) worst case (skewed tree).

23. **What is a full binary tree?**

    - Insert, extract min/max: O(log n); peek: O(1).

### Hash Tables
28. **What is a hash table? How does it work?**  
    - A hash table maps keys to values using a hash function to compute an array index.

29. **What are collisions in hash tables? How are they handled?**

40. **What is a red-black tree? How does it maintain balance?**  
    - A red-black tree uses color properties (red/black) and rules (e.g., no two red nodes in a row) to ensure balance.

41. **What is the difference between AVL and red-black trees?**

    - Tabulation uses a bottom-up approach, filling a table iteratively to solve subproblems.

56. **What is the difference between memoization and tabulation?**  
    - Memoization is top-down (recursive), tabulation is bottom-up (iterative). Tabulation often uses less stack space.

### Greedy Algorithms

### Backtracking
59. **What is backtracking? Where is it applied?**  
    - Backtracking tries all possibilities, undoing choices if they fail. **Applications**: N-Queens, Sudoku, permutations.

60. **How does backtracking differ from brute force?**

80. **What is the best-case time complexity of quick sort?**  
    - O(n log n), when the pivot splits the array evenly.

81. **Why is merge sort preferred over quick sort in some cases?**  
    - Merge sort guarantees O(n log n) and is stable; quick sort can be O(n¬≤) and is unstable.

82. **What is the space complexity of merge sort?**  
    - O(n) due to temporary arrays for merging.

83. **How does pivot choice affect quick sort performance?**  
    - Good pivots (e.g., median) ensure O(n log n); poor pivots (e.g., first element) lead to O(n¬≤).

84. **What is the time complexity of finding the maximum element in an array?**  
    - O(n), as each element must be checked.
